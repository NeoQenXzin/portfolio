															My coding adventure began in 2020, marking a significant professional evolution. 
															I undertook a professional transition into the field of coding and computing. Since then, I've achieved several significant milestones that have enriched my skill set and broadened my horizons:

															- In 2020, I earned technical certifications in web integration and technical web development, providing me with a robust foundation in both frontend and backend technologies.

															- 2021 marked a pivotal year, as I attained the RNCP (RÃ©pertoire National des Certifications Professionnelles) title as a web developer, validating my expertise in web and mobile development.

															- Building upon this momentum, I continued to evolve as a developer and, in 2023, obtained the title rncp of software developer and designer, showcasing my commitment to mastering various facets of the field.
